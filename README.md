# Weather-Forecast-API
This is a project that uses OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather forecast data based on user input location.



The code is used to obtain the details about the weather based on user input location. The temperature in celsius and fahrenheit,followed by humidity and the wind speed will be displayed.
In order to request the necessary information from OpenWeatherMap API we use requests. To run the code, we have to install requests.
requests can be installed by typing pip install requests in the command promt.
The api key is to be created in the OpenWeatherMap.
